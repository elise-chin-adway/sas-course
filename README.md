# SAS Course (Coorpacademy)

## Description
This course is for absolute beginners as well as advanced users who wish to learn SAS programming. Delivered in a highly visual style, these immersive lectures will equip you with the cutting-edge tool used in many industries, primarily in pharma, finance, and insurance areas.

Simplified into just 4 main areas, this course is an accelerated path to learning SAS programming. Data preparation will teach you how to import data from multiple sources, create new variables, write SAS functions, and understand what goes on behind the scenes in SAS datasets. Data structuring will make you leap into transforming data to a new level by merging and joining multiple datasets together, or turning them upside-down (sorting) and sideways (transposing). Data visualization will propel you further into the world of analytics and obtain insightful inferences from what is inside your data.

The final section will take you into the world of macro programming that teaches you how to write your code professionally and elegantly.

At the end of the course, you will try out most concepts discussed in this course through a coding exercise that will take you through these sections in preparation for your own SAS certification.
